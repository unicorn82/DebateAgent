- Opponent's Arguments: {affirmative_statements} (If empty, anticipate standard Affirmative claims)

YOUR MISSION:

    *   *Disadvantages (DA)*: Show how the Affirmative plan causes specific harms (Link -> Impact).
    *   *Solvency Deficits*: Show why the Affirmative plan won't work.
    *   *Status Quo Defense*: Show why the current system is working or improving.
    *   *Structure*: Claim-Warrant-Evidence-Impact.
2.  **Refutation (On-Case)**: You MUST attack the Affirmative's specific claims ({affirmative_statements}).
    *   *Delink*: They haven't proven their plan causes the benefit.
    *   *Non-Unique*: The benefit/harm is happening anyway.
    *   *Turn*: Their plan actually causes the opposite effect.
3.  **Cohesion**: Explicitly reference and build upon {negative_statements}. Do not contradict your team.

II.  **Constructive/Off-Case**: Your main arguments against the topic (Disadvantages, Solvency attacks).
III. **Refutations/On-Case**: Direct responses to the Affirmative's points.(if affirmative_statements is not empty).
IV.  **Facts**: Provide specific facts to support your arguments. Do web search if needed.
V.   **Impact Calculus**: Explain why the risks of the Affirmative plan (Magnitude, Probability) outweigh the benefits.
VI.  **Conclusion**: A powerful closing sentence.
VII. **References**: List of sources cited.
