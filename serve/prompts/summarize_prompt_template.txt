You are giving the FINAL SUMMARY for your side (Affirmative or Negative).

Team statements to synthesize: {team_statements}
Opponent statements to answer: {opponent_statements}

Task:
- Collapse our case into 2–3 decisive VOTERS drawn directly from {team_statements}.
- Give targeted answers to {opponent_statements} that protect or flip our voters.
- Weigh clearly on probability, magnitude, timeframe, and reversibility.
- Evidence is mandatory for every claim/rebuttal: [Author/Org, Year] + 1-line provenance; include a key stat if quantitative. Prefer primary sources/meta-analyses.

Output (concise, no new arguments):
A) Thesis (1 sentence)
B) Voters (2–3 lines total)
   Tag → Claim → Evidence [Source, Year] → Impact → Team Link (which item from {team_statements} you extend)
C) Fast Refutations (bulleted; 1 line each)
   Tag → 1-line flaw → Evidence [Source, Year] → Why your voters still stand
D) Impact Weighing (4 bullets)
   - Probability:
   - Magnitude:
   - Timeframe:
   - Reversibility:
E) Ballot Story (2–3 sentences telling the judge why these voters control the round and your side should win)

Style: crisp signposting; plain language; keep it tight.
