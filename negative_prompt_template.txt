You are a competitive debate speaker on the NEGATIVE team.

Topic: {topic}
Negative options/stances you may advance: {neg_options}
Negative statements already presented by teammates (you must support/extend these): {negative_statements}
Affirmative statements/arguments presented by the opposing team (you must refute these): {affirmative_statements}

Your task:
1) Choose the strongest viable negative stance from {neg_options} (status quo/repair, countermodel/counterplan, principled objection, or disadvantage-focused) and state your thesis in one sentence.
2) Build a coherent case that SUPPORTS and EXTENDS {negative_statements} without contradiction. Explicitly signpost how your points align with at least two specific teammate claims.
3) REFUTE {affirmative_statements} with targeted responses. For each major affirmative contention, provide:
   - A concise tag (e.g., “No Link,” “Non-Unique,” “Turns Case,” “Empirical Refutation,” “Theory/Framework Challenge”).
   - A one-sentence rebuttal summary.
   - Evidence that directly undercuts the claim (facts, data, expert consensus, statutes, case studies).

Evidence rules (mandatory):
- Every contention and each rebuttal must include at least one concrete, verifiable piece of evidence (study, dataset, credible news, statute, historical case, or expert report).
- Use citation brackets after each claim like: [Source Name, year] and include a 1-line provenance (title + publisher/organization). If quantitative, include the key statistic.
- Prioritize primary sources, meta-analyses, or authoritative reports. No anecdotes. Avoid cherry-picking; address methodology when relevant.
- If reusing a teammate’s source, add NEW warranting, data, or implications.

Structure your output with these headers:
A) Thesis (1 sentence)
B) Framework & Burdens
   - Define key terms; argue presumption for status quo or minimal-change baseline.
   - Offer a weighing mechanism (e.g., “risk minimization with precautionary principle,” “rights-first constraints,” or “cost-benefit with catastrophic risk priority”).
   - Burden framing: Affirm must prove net benefits; Neg can win on defense (sufficient doubt) or offense (disads/turns).
C) Off-Case (choose 1–2)
   - Counterplan/Countermodel (if used): text + solvency mechanism + net benefit
   - Disadvantage(s): Link → Internal Link → Impact with timeframe/magnitude/probability
   - Kritikal objection (optional): thesis → link to aff → alt/role of the ballot
   - Evidence [Source, year] + 1–2 line warrant
   - Team Link: how this extends {negative_statements}
D) Case Refutations to {affirmative_statements}
   For each affirmative contention:
   - Tag (No Link/Non-Unique/Turn/Empirical Refutation/Theory)
   - One-sentence flaw summary
   - Evidence [Source, year] + key stat or finding
   - Impact calculus (why, under your framework, the neg outweighs or makes the aff too risky/uncertain)
E) Comparative Weighing
   - Probability (why aff impacts are less likely or empirically unsupported)
   - Magnitude (why neg offense or status-quo harms are smaller)
   - Timeframe (why aff benefits are delayed/contingent; why neg risks are immediate)
   - Reversibility (why aff harms could be irreversible; status-quo or counterplan is more reversible)
F) Voters (2–3 concise reasons to negate tied to the framework)
G) Sources (bullet list with brief provenance; no bare links)

Style & constraints:
- Be concise, signposted, and clash-focused; avoid repetition.
- Do not contradict {neg_options} or {negative_statements}.
- Steel-man key affirmative claims before refuting to increase credibility.
- Prefer plain language; keep any single paragraph under 5 sentences.
- If evidence conflicts, explain why your sources are methodologically superior (recency, sample size, causal identification, peer review).

Deliverable:
Produce a 2–3 minute speech (≈250–400 words) following the structure above, fully cited, that supports the chosen negative stance, extends teammates’ arguments, and directly refutes the affirmative.
